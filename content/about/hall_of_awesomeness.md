## LeDataSciFi LeContest Champions 

Each year, the final assignment is a contest that gives students a chance to showcase their accumulated skills. 

The stakes are high! The winner walks away with a trophy, and gets their name emblazoned on the super high quality trophy.

## Great Projects 

Every year, students put together great projects. Some of these are below. The modal project creates an awesome website. In 2022, Wall Street Bets was the first team to make a dashboard. In 2023, more teams made dashboards. 

_Note: Dashboards on streamlit may take a few minutes to load initially if they haven't been used in a while. Please let me know if any of the below don't work anymore._
