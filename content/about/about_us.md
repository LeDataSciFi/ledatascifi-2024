### Drop-in Hours aka "Office Hours"

They are listed on the [discussion board for your class](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2024/discussions). **Office hour schedules can and do change during the semester, so please check back!** 

_Note: You can't see the discussion board until you complete the [set up instructions.](02_Setup)_

```{note}  
**I suspect that the initial learning curve will be steep, so we have posted a lot of office hours. Around Valentines Day, we will reduce our explicit office hours. Remember, when you get stuck, _especially_ on installation and set up issues,**
- look at the [help](help) page
- post a question in our [discussion board](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2024/discussions)
