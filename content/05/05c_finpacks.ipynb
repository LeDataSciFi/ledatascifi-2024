    "    - Low-cost way to brute force some tasks (brainstorming, rough drafts, outlining, editing, starting code)\n",
    "    - Its creativity has limits (bad at: \"write a shocking surprise that was foreshadowed earlier\")\n",
    "    - But it is an eager brainstormer ([in one standard creativity test, it beat 90% of humans](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2303/2303.12003.pdf))\n",
    "    - And it can be harnessed: \"write a rap about monetary supply in the style of Common\", \"draft a book proposal/sales copy/etc on topic X\", \"write a corporate memo addressing X, Y, and Z\", \"suggest 3 options for X\", \"provide more detail on the second point\"\n",
    "    - Responses are often vague and lack specifics\n",
    "1. Do not assume its output is correct or the truth\n",
    "    - Meaning: It will confidently lie and make up things (so-called \"hallucinations\" and \"bullshiting\")\n",
