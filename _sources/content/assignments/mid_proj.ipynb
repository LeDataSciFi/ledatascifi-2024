    "- Basic question: Do 10-K filings contain value-relevant information in the **sentiment** of the text?\n",
    "    - Sentiment: Does the word have a positive or negative tone (e.g. \"confident\" vs \"against\")\n",
    "- Specific questions: Is the positive or negative sentiment in a 10-K associated with better/worse stock returns?\n",
    "    - This is called a \"cross-sectional event study\"\n",
    "    - Expected minimum output: Scatterplot (x = document's sentiment score, y = stock returns around the 10-K's release) with regression lines; formatted well\n",
    "    - Advanced output: Regression tables, heatmaps, better scatterplots/similar\n",
    "- New data science technique: Textual analysis and sentiment analysis. \n",
    "- Data needed:\n",
    "    - Returns: Stock returns for firms around their 10-K dates\n",
    "    - Sentiment measures will be created from the text in their 10-K filings. (We will need to download the 10-K files and get the text within them!)\n",

    "    - It is not a technical document and not a bunch of hasty code. It should be well formatted and clean in terms of text, code, and output. Don't show extraneous print statements you wrote while ABCD'ing and checking your code. Treat it like a Word document that happens to have some code (but just enough to do the analysis and show outputs). \n",
    "    - There is no \"page expectation\" or \"page limit\". Aim to provide sufficient analysis and explanation but in a concise and clear way. Bullet points are fine in places, but you should have a few places with paragraph-style discussion.\n",
