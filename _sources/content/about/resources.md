You could start trying [to analyze it here](http://drivendata.co/blog/worldbank-poverty-benchmark/). This has a good example of the process you might follow. After you're done, you can see [the winner's code and discussion of the winning approach](https://github.com/drivendataorg/pover-t-tests/tree/9a1918856c5e6ee537caed103eb80dabefb2fe44)

  - [Predict box office for movies](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction). VaultML claims they can do this by reading the screenplays and using textual analysis tools
  - [Wine, but not necessarily the best data source](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)
- [UC Irvine has a data repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), some of these are available via scikit package
  - [Predicting where the wine is from (wine/location](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine) <--- easy starter challenge (where is the wine from?)
