    "\n",
    "You've already merged datasets. But so far, our examples have been \"well-behaved\" so it was easy to just proceed. But real world datasets are messy (bad variable names, poor documentation) and big, and so merging isn't always as easy as \"just do it\".\n",

    "\n",
    "- `right = <df>`, `left = <df>` - name of your datasets\n",
    "- `on = <var>` or `on = [<var1>,<var2>,...]` - what variable(s) to use to match from the left and right datasets. These are your \"keys\". \n",
    "    - if the variable names aren't the same in both datasets (e.g. \"ID\" in one and \"identity\" in the other), use `left_on` and `right_on` instead of `on` to specify the names in each\n",
    "    - if the variables are the index variables, use `left_index = True` and/or `right_index = True` instead of `on`\n",
    "- `how` - what observations are in the resulting dataset, [see below](#how-left-v-right-v-inner-v-outer)\n",
    "- `suffix` - if a variable is in both datasets, how should we name each. \n",
    "    - **It's a good idea to always use this option and specify the source, because the default option makes uninformative variable names! **\n",
    "- `indicator=True` will create a variable saying which dataset the variable came from\n",
    "- `validate` = \"one_to_one\", \"one_to_many\", or \"many_to_one\". Will check if the merge is actually what you think it is. Useful!\n",

    "```{admonition} Be careful with the validate option \n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always use the \"smallest\" option you think is correct: If you're doing a 1:1, type \"one_to_one\"\n",
    "- Don't simply change it until the merge \"works\"! **Errors are good!** \n",
    "    - either you're merging \"wrong\" (picked the wrong \"on\" vars), \n",
    "    - or the data has problems (duplicates where there shouldn't be), \n",
    "    - or you misunderstand the data\n",
    "    - M:M can be dangerous\n",
